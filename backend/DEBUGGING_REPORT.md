## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Database Model Issues ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: Duplicate Brand model definitions causing SQLAlchemy table conflicts
```python
# BEFORE: Conflicting definitions in brand.py and product.py
class Brand(Base):
    __tablename__ = "brands"  # Duplicate table name
```

**Solution**: Consolidated Brand model in `brand.py` and removed duplicate from `product.py`
```python
# AFTER: Single unified Brand model with all required fields
class Brand(Base):
    __tablename__ = "brands"
    # Extended fields for competitor analysis and product management
    industry = Column(String, index=True)
    target_audience = Column(JSON)
    # ... additional fields
```

**Impact**: Eliminated SQLAlchemy mapping conflicts, enabled proper model relationships

### 2. SQLAlchemy Relationship Configuration ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: Missing relationship back-references causing import errors
```python
# ERROR: sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: Mapper 'Mapper[Video(videos)]' has no property 'performance_predictions'
```

**Solution**: Added all missing relationship back-references across models
```python
# Video model updated with missing relationships
performance_predictions = relationship("VideoPerformancePrediction", back_populates="video")
ab_variants = relationship("ABTestVariant", back_populates="video")
analytics = relationship("VideoAnalytics", back_populates="video")
```

**Impact**: Full relationship mapping established, model navigation functional

### 3. Database Type Compatibility ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: JSONB PostgreSQL-specific types causing SQLite compatibility issues
```python
# ERROR: Compiler can't render element of type JSONB
from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import JSONB
brand_guidelines = Column(JSONB)
```

**Solution**: Replaced JSONB with standard JSON type for cross-database compatibility
```python
# FIXED: Compatible across SQLite, PostgreSQL
from sqlalchemy import JSON
brand_guidelines = Column(JSON)
```

**Impact**: Models now work with SQLite (testing) and PostgreSQL (production)

### 4. Data Factory Configuration ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: Factory field mismatches with actual model schemas
```python
# ERROR: 'description' is an invalid keyword argument for Brand
class BrandFactory(factory.Factory):
    description = factory.LazyAttribute(...)  # Field doesn't exist
```

**Solution**: Aligned factory fields with actual model definitions
```python
# FIXED: Factory fields match Brand model
class BrandFactory(factory.Factory):
    colors = factory.LazyAttribute(lambda obj: {"primary": fake.hex_color(), "secondary": fake.hex_color()})
    voice = factory.LazyAttribute(lambda obj: {"tone": "professional", "dos": "Be authentic"})
```

**Impact**: Factories can now generate valid test data for all models

### 5. API Schema Consistency ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: Pydantic schemas missing required fields for API operations
```python
# ERROR: 'BrandCreate' object has no attribute 'name'
class BrandCreate(BaseModel):
    url: HttpUrl  # Missing name field
```

**Solution**: Added missing fields to API schemas
```python
# FIXED: Complete schema definition
class BrandCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    url: HttpUrl
```

**Impact**: API endpoints can now properly validate request data

### 6. Dependency Management ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: Multiple missing Python packages causing import failures
- Missing: `email-validator`, `python-jose`, `aiohttp`, `anthropic`, `pinecone`
- Wrong package: `pinecone-client` vs `pinecone`

**Solution**: Comprehensive dependency installation and package corrections
```bash
# Installed core dependencies
pip install email-validator python-jose[cryptography] passlib[bcrypt]
pip install aiohttp aiofiles openai tiktoken tenacity anthropic
pip uninstall pinecone-client && pip install pinecone
```

**Impact**: All core imports now functional, services can be instantiated
